# Sell Yourself (sys)

## The Core Insight

You already have gifts, skills, and talents that can help the people around you. You already have the ability to monetize them. You don't need an LLC, a business license, or permission from anyone. You can do this today.

The problem isn't capability—it's friction. There's no easy way to tell your friends "hey, I'm actually really good at this thing, and I'd do it for you for $20." It feels awkward. There's no platform that makes it feel natural.

**Sell Yourself** removes that friction.

## What Is It?

A peer-to-peer skills marketplace for your existing social circle. Not strangers on the internet—your actual friends, followers, and community.

Think of it as the intersection of:
- **Venmo** (casual peer-to-peer money transfer)
- **Craigslist services** (but only people you trust)
- **TikTok** (social, video-first, personality-driven)

## The Two Sides

### 1. "I Can Do This"
Post your skills. What are you good at? What would you enjoy doing for someone else?

Examples:
- Foot massage - $30/hour
- Help you move furniture - $25/hour
- Cook you dinner - $50
- Edit your resume - $40
- Teach you guitar basics - $35/session
- Walk your dog - $15
- Build you a website - $200
- Listen to you vent for an hour - $20
- Help you pick an outfit - $25
- Proofread your essay - $15

The beauty is in the mundane. These aren't "professional services"—they're things you're naturally good at that your friends would genuinely pay for.

### 2. "I Need This"
Post your needs. What do you wish someone would just do for you?

Examples:
- Need someone to help me practice Spanish
- Looking for someone to go to the gym with me
- Need help assembling IKEA furniture
- Want someone to teach me how to cook
- Need a ride to the airport Saturday

The platform matches needs to skills. Your friend posted they need help moving? You posted you're strong and have a truck? Match.

## The Social Layer

This isn't a marketplace of strangers. Trust comes from existing relationships:

- Your TikTok followers
- Your Instagram mutuals
- Your actual friend group
- Friends of friends (optional expansion)

When you see a skill listing, you see it's from someone you already follow. Someone whose content you've watched. Someone you have context on.

**The awkwardness disappears.** It's not "hiring a stranger for a massage"—it's "oh, Sarah from my TikTok is really good at massage and charges $30, that's amazing."

## Consent Is Built In

You can always say no.

Someone requests your service? You approve or decline. No pressure. No obligation. The platform makes it socially acceptable to decline—it's just how the system works.

You can also:
- Block specific people
- Set availability windows
- Pause your listings
- Limit who can see what

## The Transaction

Keep it simple. No payment processing complexity (for now).

Each listing includes:
- Your Venmo handle
- Your Cash App
- Your PayPal
- Or just "cash"

The platform facilitates the connection. The money moves however you two decide.

Later: in-app payments, escrow, dispute resolution. But that's later.

## Why This Works

### 1. The Skills Already Exist
Everyone is good at something. Most people are good at many things. These skills are currently going to waste because there's no marketplace for them.

### 2. The Trust Already Exists
You already trust your friends. You already know who's reliable, who's talented, who you'd want to spend time with. The social graph is pre-built.

### 3. The Money Already Flows
People already Venmo each other constantly. This just gives it structure and permission.

### 4. It's Ambient
You're not "starting a business." You're just... available. If someone needs what you offer, cool. If not, no big deal. It's low-pressure monetization of things you'd probably do anyway.

## The Name

**Sell Yourself** - because that's literally what you're doing. You're putting yourself out there. Your skills. Your time. Your talents.

It's vulnerable. It's brave. It's also completely natural—we just haven't had a platform that makes it easy.

**sys** - the abbreviation. Clean. Technical. A system for selling yourself.

## Why Now?

The creator economy proved people will pay for personality. TikTok proved everyone has an audience. Venmo proved peer-to-peer payments are normal.

The only thing missing is the connection layer. A place where "I'm good at this" meets "I need that" within communities of trust.

That's Sell Yourself.
